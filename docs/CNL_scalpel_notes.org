* Notes by day
**  1-10-23    
- Loaded pycortex and set up github repo
- Currently stuck on importing subject to pycortex db
** 1-12-23
- Still stuck on importing subjects
- Command mri_convert IS running in terminal, something at issue with kernel?
     - FREESURFER_HOME is set  
     
- BUT when command runs in terminal, new error nibabel function get_affine is deprecated for .affine, change to pycortex breaks 
     - Changed pycortex code line 198 to include .affine, no change

** 1-17-23
SOLVED: needed to run SetUpFreesurfer inside of virtual environment
export FREESURFER_HOME=~/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh

Add the two above lines to conda environment activate.d with the following 

cd $CONDA_PREFIX
mkdir -p ./etc/conda/activate.d
mkdir -p ./etc/conda/deactivate.d
touch ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
touch ./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh

edit this file ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh :
export FREESURFER_HOME=~/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh

NEXT:
Not runnning in the jupyter notebook CNL_scalpel_scratch.ipynb like equivalent code is running in pycortex_subject_test.pycortex
error is unrecognized command mri_convert
     - Implies that kernal is not finding SetUpFreesurfer.sh when kernel is activated in jupyter vs when environment active in terminal

OTHER ISSUE:
Still empty! /Users/benparker/miniconda3/envs/CNL_scalpel/share/pycortex/db/100307/anatomicals
Not sure if this needs to have files in it, but likely should after running import_subj
Raises question of whether the command is runnning correctly in terminal as well


* Issues 


* TODO
Potentially older version of freesurfer required

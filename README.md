# CNL_scalpel

## Use case

scalpel is a tool for easy interaction with freesurfer cortical surface reconstructions in python

inlcuded in the repo are

- simple object-oriented design for interacting with fs subjects
- reading, editing, and writing fs label files
- interactive plotting in jupyter
- ability to call several frequently used freesurfer functions (label2label, label2annot, mris_anatomical_stats etc.)
- segmentation of cortical surfaces (centroids, gyral gaps, gyral crowns, disjoint sulci, surface thresholding etc.)

## Requirements

Install src files in virtual environment with  `pip install -e . --use-pep517` from the repo home directory


## Overview

### i/o for surfaces and labels

### plotting

### freesurfer functions

### parcellation methods

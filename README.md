# CNL_scalpel

## Use case

scalpel is a tool for easy interaction with freesurfer cortical surface reconstructions in python  

inlcuded in the repo are

- simple object-oriented design for interacting with fs subjects
- interactive plotting in jupyter
- ability to call freesurfer functions in python (label2label, label2annot, etc.)
- segmentation of cortical surfaces (centroids, gyral gaps, gyral crowns, disjoint sulci, surface thresholding etc.)

## Requirements

Install src files in virtual environment with  `pip install -e . --use-pep517` from the repo home directory
